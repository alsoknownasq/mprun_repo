## How It Works...
### 1. Set up the course:
- Use the libraries tab to add course features as needed, such as rails or jumps. You can also
import your own SVG files to add features to the scene.
- Scale, rotate, or edit items to achieve the desired course setup.
### 2. Draw your path:
- Use the `Path` tool to draw your line along the course.
- The path item colors and stroke styles can be changed for any reason you find necessary.
### 3. Label your path:
- Use the `Line and Label` tool to label tricks along your path.
### 4. And it's that simple.

# Why MPRUN Though?
MPRUN can build a solid plan going into competitions, creating a proper mindset for athletes. This is important
because it ensures athletes don't go into competitions without a plan and a 'just wing it' mindset.

> MPRUN is a comprehensive software designed for planning snowboard and ski competition runs. Users can customize 
> courses, draw their path, label tricks, and do so much more. It promotes strategic planning for athletes, preventing
