# Introducing MPRUN - the ultimate competition run planning software for on-snow athletes
## But what is that?

MPRUN's intention is to **help athletes create proper mindsets** going into competitions.

Tricks are getting harder in competitions, and nowadays _mental game is 90% part of it_. Our main goal is to help increase the performance of your mental game by using a simple technic, **Physical Visualization**.

**Physical Visualization (PZ)**, is the process of taking something we normally visualize in our brain and putting it on a physical object (like a piece of paper). MPRUN does exactly that, where you draw your competition run and print it out to a piece of paper. You can even export your run and save it to your phone.

> [!WARNING]
> PZ does not guarantee perfect results; it is a tool that can be used to ASSIST athletes (our full disclaimer can be found in the "DISCLAIMER" window shown on startup of MPRUN).

## Why does it exist?

As you may know, everything is in a constant change. That's why MPRUN was created, to help improve adapting to this constant change. 

It doesn't help everybody, but as an on-snow athlete myself, I know it can assist those that struggle in competition environments reduce stress and pressure to perform.

## How does it work? 

_You can find a demo video on <kbd>[MPRUN's website↗️](https://sites.google.com/view/mprun/home)</kbd>, but here's a simplification on how the process works._

1. Create your course
> Use a drag and drop editor to drag **Course Elements** on to the scene (**Course Elements** are just SVG items representing course features like rails, jumps, and even halfpipes)

2. Draw your line
> Use line drawing tools to draw your "path" along the course (where your going to ride, what features your going to hit)

3. Label your line
> Use labelling tools to label your tricks along your "path" (what tricks you do on each feature)

And that's it! You can then export your run and print it out to a piece of paper.
